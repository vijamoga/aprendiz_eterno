The "Aprendiz Eterno" personal project has no deadline, and is subject to numerous and ad-infinitum updates while I dive in and discover new background material with which develop my own texts and reflections.
Furthermore, Spanish is my mother tongue, so it is easier for me to think and work on it rather than English.
BUT, I am aware of the omni-pressence of English all around the WEB, so I consider a great possibility to create a parallel repo (Eternal learner?) that mimics every (if any) finished text that I might upload to the ever-ongoing Aprendiz Eterno one.
